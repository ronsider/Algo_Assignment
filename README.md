# Algo_Assignment
## An optional assignment received in algorithms course

### Instructions

Find a total sum sub-matrix within a **given area** and return it's coordinates.

  Top left corner(of found area) indices(iLeft,jLeft).
  
  Bottom right corner(iRight,jRight).

Class constructor takes the following form:

Public MaxSubRecatangle(int[][]data).

Matrix information will consist of the folllowing triplets(i,j,v),whereas i represents row coordinate, j is column coordinate and v is the value of the element inside matrix.
